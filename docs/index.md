    ![Hevellyn Gomes](/images/hevs-180x250.jpg){ align=left }

    For the last 7 years I have been working with OpenShift, since 3.7 version running `openshift-install` with Ansible, migrating then to a more robust OpenShift 4 approach using ignite files, and for the last 2 years, focused on the Cloud, with managed services in Azure and AWS.
