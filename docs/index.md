    For the last 7 years I have been working with OpenShift, since v3.7 with the old and gold `openshift-install` with Ansible, migrating then to a more robust OpenShift 4 approach using ignite files, and for the last 2 years, focused on the Cloud, with managed services in Azure and AWS. During these years, learning the value of the customer experience has been rewarding while also working across multiple teams, always learning a new and shiny technical bit. This blog is a compilated  of everything that have been most useful for me. ðŸ§µ An eternal work in progress.
